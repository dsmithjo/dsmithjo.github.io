### About

As a quantitative researcher, I'm interested in the application of political economy theory and empirical methods to puzzles and problems in international politics, sports, public health, and medicine.

A repository of my work can be found [here](https://dsmithjo.github.io/#publications). 

You'll find a list of my [publications](https://dsmithjo.github.io/publications), [presentations](https://dsmithjo.github.io/presentations), and [ongoing projects](https://dsmithjo.github.io/ongoingandunpub), with links to the articles, analysis, or code, where possible.
