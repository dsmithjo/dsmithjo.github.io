### About

As a quantitative researcher, I'm interested in the application of political economy theory and empirical methods to puzzles and problems in international politics, sports, public health, and medicine. 
A repository of my work can be found [here](https://dsmithjo.github.io/#publications). You'll find a list of my publications, presentations, and ongoing research, with links to the articles, analysis, or code, where possible.
